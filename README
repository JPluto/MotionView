MotionView
----------

MotionView is intended to be used as a base class to your views to give them motion capabilities. Using touch gestures the derived view will be able to be moved in the following ways:

 - moved around
 - rotated
 - pinch scaled 
 - hit selected to become the front most view (when there is more than one view overlapping each other).


Tasks
-----

A MotionView have the following options it can set to determine its characteristics:


@property (nonatomic, assign) int options;

An options property that defines the pan and tap gesture characteristics. 
The default options value is  MotionOptionSliding | TapOptionBounce


@property (nonatomic, assign) float friction;

Sets the friction value when sliding to a stop. 
Default: 0.15


@property (nonatomic, assign) float bounceScale;

Sets how much the view scales during a bounce animation. 
Default: 0.02



MotionOption:

The motion option sets the gesture characteristics of a panning view.

 MotionStatic - When the touch pan gesture ends the view stops where it is.
 MotionSliding (default) - When the touch pan gesture ends the view slides to a stop. 

TapOption:

 TapOptionNoAnimation - No animation. The view will immediately appear on top.
 TapOptionBounce (default) - The view will appear to bounce to the top.


NOTE:

This is was something I played around with out of interest of understanding how a touch interface could be used to move, scale, select items (UIView derived items) with animations to mimic a regular surface. Hence it is not complete and may not work as expected.
